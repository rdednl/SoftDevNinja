# SoftDev Challenges

This repository hosts the challenges for the SoftDev course held at
[Eurecom](www.eurecom.fr/en/), Sophia Antipolis, France, during the 2016 Fall semester.

The challenges were divided in three main parts:

* **shell**: bash, awk, sed
* **python**: the name is self-explanatory
* **dev**: makefile, automake, gdb
